🚀 #CaseStudy: Empowering AtliQ Technologies with Data Insights 📈

I'm thrilled to share a recent project where I led an end-to-end #DataAnalysis endeavour for AtliQ Technologies.

#CaseStudy

📊 **Challenges Faced:**

The company's Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, was grappling with challenges related to sales reports and business insights. The rapidly evolving market presented difficulties in tracking sales effectively, and regional managers provided extensive Excel files rather than concise insights.

🔍 **The Approach:**

To tackle these issues, Bhavin sought an analytical solution and robust data visualization. They collaboratively settled on implementing an AIMS Grid, a framework designed to clarify objectives and define success criteria for the project. The data analytics team played a pivotal role in resolving these challenges.

📈 **Key Achievements:**

I just connect #MySQL to a database housing over 150,000 sales records. I derived key insights, including sales amounts, total sales counts, and customer counts.

📊 **Data Transformation:**

Subsequently, I employed #PowerBI for #DataTransformation and #DataCleaning. Within Power BI, I established connections between various tables through #DataModelling. Data cleansing was carried out using #PowerQuery, addressing issues like duplicate entries and currency conversion.

📉 **Results:**

Following these meticulous steps, the final stage involved crafting #DataVisualizations within Power BI, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive #PowerBIDashboard report that empowers AtliQ Technologies to monitor sales records effectively.

In this case study, success is defined by tangible improvements in #Profits and reduced expenses for the company.
